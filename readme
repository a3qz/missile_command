Comments - to run, for the most part instructions are onscreen.  This is our take on the Atari 2600 version of Missile Command.  For reference, the things streaming down at the bottom are referred to as missiles, the things you lauch with clicks are called bombs, and the things you defend are called cities.  It is played by clicking on the screen to shoot a bomb at incoming missiles - the missiles leave a trail that disappears if you shoot their head.  If your cities are all hit, you lost the game.  Your score increases every time you shoot down a missile, and at the end of each level, when the number of cities you have remaining is counted up and added.  You can quit the game by pressing escape to enter the pause menu, or by pressing escape at the title screen.  You can also from the pause menu choose to resume or to start a new game - in the case of the latter, your score will be reset.  The biggest difference between our game is that we chose not to limit the number of shots the player can make, as we felt it added too much challenge.
